## הקדמה - Introduction

The Few Who Seek to Ascend

"I have seen those who seek to ascend, but they are few. They long to climb up, but the ladder is hidden from their view. They contemplate the books of the ancients, seeking to discover the paths of life; the way upon which to tread and the deeds that will uplift their soul to its supernal root, so that they may adhere to HaShem-יהו"ה, who is Eternal Perfection, blessed is He; similar to the prophets who spent all their days adhering to their Maker. Through that adhesion the Holy Spirit rested upon them and showed them the path where light dwells, enlightening their eyes in the secrets of Torah, as King David, peace be upon him, said,1Psalms 119 “Unveil my eyes, that I may behold wonders from Your Torah.”

The Ancient Chassidim

"After the prophets came the ancient Chassidim. These were hermits who sought to follow in the footsteps of the prophets and emulate them. Living in caverns and deserts, they secluded themselves from society. Some remained secluded in their homes but behaved like those in the deserts. Day and night they never ceased praising their Creator through studying His Torah and singing the Psalms of King David, peace be upon him, which gladden the heart. This they did constantly, until their mind adhered to the supernal lights with powerful and mighty yearning. This was their practice all their days, until they rose to the level of receiving the Holy Spirit, prophesying unceasingly. However, since each one acted alone and the character of one person is dissimilar to that of another, the means and methods of how these holy men served HaShem-יהו"ה, blessed is He, were lost to us, so that we cannot emulate their ways. Because of this, the hearts and knowledge of the following generations dwindled and people who attained the Holy Spirit vanished. These holy men went to their resting places, leaving us groaning from thirst and hunger. Finally, hopelessness of ever exploring this wondrous wisdom sprouted in the hearts of men. Only two or three grains may be found in a stalk of wheat; one in a city or two in a clan, who seek water, but there is none, for all vision has been sealed. This is because the methods of how to approach and come close to the inner holiness were never written in a book."

Those Who Invoke Angels

"Later, there arose men who sought to attain spiritual levels by invoking the angels, through the power of invoking their holy names. However, they hoped for light and beheld darkness; for the angels they conjured were of a very low order, who were appointed to affect matters of this lowly world. This being so, they are composed of both good and evil and themselves perceive neither Truth nor the supernal lights. Therefore, they revealed matters that were mixed with good and evil, truth and error and vain things; matters, such as mystical cures, alchemy (the art of transforming silver into gold and copper or tin into silver), amulets, oaths and incantations. Furthermore, these people fell to imbibing wine and strong drink. If only they would have been as devoted to studying Torah and doing mitzvot! They would have learned from the example of the four great sages of Israel who entered Paradise.2The word paradise is a corruption of the Hebrew word Pardes. Not one of them left unscathed, except for the saintly Rabbi Akiva, and even in his case, the attendant angels attempted to eject him. Had not HaShem-יהו"ה helped him, he would not have entered in peace and left in peace. If even the greatest sages of Israel were thus endangered, how much more so, we, who cannot begin to compare to them? Truth be told, these holy sages aspired to attain very great levels, bordering on prophecy. Therefore, they were placed in harm’s way. However, in regard to us, would that we should merit even a tiny glimmer of the Holy spirit, such as the revelation of Eliyahu the Prophet, which many have merited to attain, as well known; or such as the revelation of the souls of the righteous Tzaddikim, as mentioned often in Sefer HaTikkunim-The book of Rectifications.3The subject of the revelation of the souls of the righteous Tzaddikim is discussed at further length in Kuntres HaShitatchut of Rabbi DovBer of Lubavitch, translated into English under the title Visiting the Gravesites of the Righteous. Furthermore, even in our times, I have witnessed holy men who merited attaining all this. Moreover, there is such a level that a person’s own soul, because of its great refinement, is revealed to him and directs him in all matters. All these ways are within reach to those who are worthy of them, even in our times. Still and all, great discernment and much experience are necessary in order that it be established upon truth, for perhaps a different spirit visited him; one that is impure. All this will be explained in Part Three, Gate Eight."

The Author's Intent

"Due to all the above, I feel compelled to free true seekers of their difficulties, by supporting their right hand and instructing them concerning the path they should follow. Therefore, I have decided to compose this book, small in quantity but great in quality; may it enlighten the eyes of the wise. I have called it, “Gates of Holiness.” In it, I will explain hidden matters that have never been openly taught in previous generations. I have received these teachings directly from the mouth of the holy man of God, the messenger of HaShem of Hosts – יהו"ה צבאות, my master and teacher, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the holy Ari’zal. Being that these are concealed and hidden matters that have forever been kept secret, I will, therefore, reveal only a hands-breadth while concealing two thousand cubits. Thus, with great difficulty, I will unlock the gates of holiness and push them open just a crack, merely the width of a pin. May it be that those who are worthy, merit entering the inner sanctum. HaShem-יהו"ה is good and will not deprive goodness from those who walk in purity. I have divided the book into four parts:


### שער 1 - Gate 1

1. **Part Four The ways of activating and attaining the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh) of Divine Inspiration In the seventh gate of the third section, we already explained that there are five levels of attainment of the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh), which are: 1. The Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh) 2. Revelations of souls of the righteous Tzaddikim 3. Revelations of angels called Maggidim 4. The revelation of the prophet Eliyahu, who is remembered for good. 5. Dreams We explained that each of these levels can be attained automatically, through a person sanctifying himself and engaging in the study of Torah, without need of any other actions. It is, however, also possible for these levels to be attained through specific courses of action, provided that the one who does so is fitting and prepared for its attainment. It is this second manner of attainment of the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh) that will be explained in this section of the book, which is a compendium of the methods already found written in the works of earlier sages. This section is divided into three gates. The first gate discusses the ways that one should approach and conduct himself in action. The second discusses the manners of attaining the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh). The third discusses the conditions and methods required for the attainment of the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh). It should be noted, however, that in my main book called Etz Chayim, I already have written a number of unifications (Yichudim) and various different wondrous paths in regard to the matter of attaining and grasping the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh). If HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He, shall allow it, I shall write them with more extended explanations in a volume unto itself. Note from the original printer: This fourth section was not copied and not included in this printed version. The reason is because it is filled with Holy Names and their permutations and many hidden secrets, that were not deemed appropriate to be printed.917However, the fourth section of Shaarei Kedushah has subsequently been printed in its entirety in Sefer Ktavim Chaddashim M’Rabbeinu Chayim Vital (Jerusalem 5748 [1988]). In the first gate, he cites various teachings from earlier Kabbalists, such as the Ramban (Nachmanides), Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Sefer Brit Menuchah, Sefer HaChassidim, Pardes Rimonim of Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, Reishit Chochmah of his student, Rabbi Eliyahu Vidas, and Rabbi Yitzchak of Acco. This section primarily consists of the manner and humility in which one should conduct oneself, so as to be a fitting receptacle for the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh), to the extent that no other practices may be necessary. The second section consists of instructional guides and practices, also cited from the earlier Kabbalists. Primarily, this section includes further instructions on complete repentance, self-purification and the attainment of holiness, seclusion, the attainment of equanimity (Hishtavut), as well as some introductions to the matter and manner of the divestment of the physical, and additional introductions regarding the matters of prophecy, the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh), and the Sefirot. The third and final gate is almost entirely excerpted from the teachings of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, of blessed memory, and are the methods of adhesion to and contemplation of the Name of HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He, primarily as it is manifest in the seventy-two names that arise from the three verses “VaYeesa-ויסע,” “VaYavo-ויבא,” and “VaYeit-ויט” (Exodus 14:19-21). However, as Rabbi Chayim Vital wrote in his introduction, “I will reveal only a hands-breadth while concealing two thousand cubits.” That is, to attain a proper understanding and approach to this section of the book, necessarily requires prerequisite knowledge of other important foundations, which were not included in this work. Nevertheless, as Rabbi Chayim Vital instructs us in his introduction, this entire work is knowledge that he received from his master and teacher, the Godly Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the Arizal, and about this fourth section he states, “I have personally tried and tested these and have found them to be effective. However, I will only enumerate their details briefly, by way of signposts that point the way.” He indeed provides such sign-posts. For, although it is well known that the teachings of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia are mostly locked gates, it is well-known that the Arizal already pointed to the student of Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, namely, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, as having graced us with the keys to these gates, and to the secrets of the Torah, in his famed work Shaarei Orah. Moreover, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla himself writes of his Ginat Egoz, which preceded his Shaarei Orah, that it includes all of the critically necessary introductions and is foundational to all his other works, and to all of Torah. In it, he elucidates the true teachings of the Kabbalah that he received from his master and teacher, Rabbi Avraham Abulafia, illuminating them in a clear and simple manner, so that they may be understood by every intelligent person. In his work Otzar Eden HaGanuz, Rabbi Avraham Abulafia himself refers to his student, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, in the greatest of terms, stating that he succeeded in that which he was taught with the greatest success, and that he attained the most wondrous success beyond even that which he was expressly taught, applying to him the words of the verse (Samuel I 16:18), “HaShem-יהו״ה was with him,” which the Talmud (Sanhedrin 93b) explains to mean that “the Halachah is like him in all areas.” Nevertheless, until our generation, this work Ginat Egoz remained hidden in manuscript form, possessed by only the righteous few. Prior to this generation, there was only one limited printing of Ginat Egoz that was brought into print by the saintly Rabbi Yishayah HaLevi Horowitz, the famed author of the Shnei Luchot HaBrit (known as the ShaLaH). Nevertheless, in our generation, Ginat Egoz has already been printed and made fully available to the public, and has also been translated and adapted into English under the title HaShem is One. It is our hope and prayer to HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He and blessed is His Name, that the publication and dissemination of these teachings will bring about the fulfillment of the prophecy (Isaiah 40:5), “The glory of HaShem-יהו"ה will be revealed and all flesh, as one, will see that the mouth of HaShem-יהו"ה has spoken.”**
