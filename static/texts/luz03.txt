Author's Introduction

Introduction of the Author:
Given that human thought is very limited in comprehending divine matters, which are hidden from human eyes, and the divine influence pressures and greatly compels one to reveal its forces, every person must strive to follow these ways, drawing wisdom from the divine influence that drives them. Since this precious influence presses upon their thoughts, compelling them to share some of it with others, the extent to which one's intellect is limited will determine the limitation of their influence. Conversely, the broader and more expansive one's intellect, the broader their influence will be when they wish to share it with others. If they possess little knowledge, they cannot share much, and if they have much, they cannot share little. If they have no influence at all, they cannot share any. How can a person give what they do not possess? The sages of the world have compared the matter of this precious upper influence to the matter of wealth, meaning that one who has been greatly blessed by God with wealth can enrich others. This distribution is based not on desire but on capacity, for some can enrich many people but may not wish to, and even to enrich themselves with true wealth, their ability may be very limited. Solomon, in his wisdom, said about such a person, "but God does not give him the power to enjoy it, and a stranger consumes it" (Ecclesiastes 6:2), indicating that God punishes them for being stingy with God's goodness. However, when one has this precious influence, it compels the mind to bring it into action unless internal or external barriers prevent the recipient. Additionally, those who receive it desire to share from what they have received. Since the influence leads to many matters, the recipient will act on these matters according to their prior thoughts or newly received upper influences, compelling them to bring various things into action—both general and particular beneficial matters or those necessary to precede the beneficial ones. This ensures that the benefit resides in a strong dwelling that unites essential and beneficial forces, like educating a child with actions that precede intellectual wisdom, as these actions are the dwelling of the intellect. Thus, without proper actions, there is no intellect because the intellect needs a dwelling to reside in; without such a dwelling, it will not reside at all. Although the essence of the intellect does not require or necessitate residing in a place, as it is not a body or a bodily force, the place it dwells in becomes sanctified because of it. This is similar to the solar light in a dark house: before the light reaches it, the house is dark. When the light arrives, the house is called illuminated, and whoever enters can see what is inside because the light resides there. The light, although a force in the sun, is not attached to the house. When the light departs, the house returns to darkness. Thus, just as the house owner benefits from the necessary things inside due to the light's presence—seeing with their eyes what is inside, fixing everything while the light is present—the same applies if the owner is diligent and wise, knowing that the light will leave at night. They will hide what needs to be hidden, reveal what needs to be revealed, and repair breaches to prevent thieves from harming while the light is there. Similarly, the human body is like a house, and its matters are the actions done by the limbs. The house owner is the spiritual soul that arranges the body's matters. When the intellect's light shines on the brain, heart, kidneys, and other places it resides, the soul, being pure and understanding the intellect's light, comprehends its presence and absence. Thus, it endeavors to correct all matters that need correcting while the intellect's light is present, understanding the nature of its presence with the body at times due to its own nature and its absence at times due to preventions. Good deeds are like the repairs of breaches, and if these breaches are not repaired by the intellect's power, harmful agents might come and cause damage, finding no prevention. The breach remains unrepaired, and a breach calls to the thief.
And because the light of the intellect is the primary reason that mends all breaches, I have composed this work to mend all breaches, and I have named it after the primary reason itself, calling it "The Light of the Intellect." With the help of this intellectual light, I aim to illuminate the hearts of the wise through this work. Since the light of the intellect is associated with the number ten, I will divide it into ten main parts, and each part will be designated by the letters of the alphabet. Each letter will encompass a concept until, collectively, they form a single name or word divided into known parts according to speech. My intention with this book is to benefit those beginning to study the Explicit Name and to guide them in understanding it, so that this work will relate to the knowledge of God, known through the prophetic tradition, in a way akin to how the wisdom of Creation relates to the Chariot. I was inspired to do this by the love of two friends, lovers of wisdom from among the best of the sons of Sinai in Sicily, who brought me close to them and followed my teachings. Their names are Rabbi Abraham the Wise and Rabbi Nathan the Intelligent, may their memory be blessed. During the short time I was with them, they requested that I write for them a brief summary of the essential principles concerning the knowledge of the exalted and revered God. Due to my great love for them, a true love, I compelled myself to fulfill their request willingly, despite the constraints of time, place, and resources which were against me. However, the strength of truth overcame these obstacles, and I endeavored to fulfill their wish with God's help.
And I know that this work will greatly benefit them and those like them, provided they adhere to the commandments of this book. This will lead them, through what I write, to the attainment of the Active Intellect. Achieving this brings one to receive divine speech. If, God forbid, something prevents them from reaching this high level, the intellectual benefits from this book will still help them understand the secrets of the Torah and the reasons behind the commandments in general. Thus, they will not fail to derive significant or minor benefits from it.
Since great intellectual illumination leads to union and speech, they may follow the path from my book, and this will ignite their desire to connect with their primary source. This will bring their intellect into action, making them metaphorically my children, and ultimately, children of God. If the children of God are metaphorically called my children, I too will benefit indirectly. Just as I would rejoice over my physical and spiritual children, how much more so would I rejoice over my intellectual offspring. If the wisdom of my soul is passed on to the souls of Abraham and Nathan, God is my reward. After this introduction explaining the reason for the book, I will begin to clarify my intentions within it. From God, I seek assistance in sharing His name with others, so that His name may be proclaimed throughout the land.
The sun and the moon will be hidden when the intellects of the prophets ascend to the heavens.
 The intellect will shine greatly, and with it, people will prophesy when the day comes after two days.
The spirit of God will rise upward and also return to hover over the waters.
The first part includes five letters, which are א'ב'ג'ד'ה' (A, B, G, D, H), and these are included in five sections marked by the letters א'ב'ר'ה'ם' (A, B, R, H, M). In these sections, I will include five topics. The first section, marked by א (A), will include the definition of every breach. The second section, marked by ב (B), will include the benefits of the essence of the boundary. The third section, marked by ר (R), will include the necessity of the existence of the benefit. The fourth section, marked by ה (H), will include the reason for the necessity of the beneficial. The fifth section, marked by מ (M), will include the issue of the loss due to the absence of the boundary. Therefore, it is appropriate to name this first part, in general, "The Bounder of Breaches."
The second part includes five letters, which are ו'ז'ח'ט'י' (V, Z, H, T, Y), and these are included in five sections marked by the letters ס'פ'ר'ד'י' (S, P, R, D, Y). In these sections, I will include five matters. The first section, marked by ס (S), will include the general concept of all commandments. The second section, marked by פ (P), will include the essence of the benefit of the commandments. The third section, marked by ר (R), will include the necessity of the existence of their benefit. The fourth section, marked by ד (D), will include the reason for the necessity in general. The fifth section, marked by י (Y), will include the issue of the loss due to the absence of the commandment. Therefore, it is appropriate to name this second part, in general, "In All the Commandments."








After completing the ten parts, before organizing them, we will include their names in an orderly fashion together. These are: the first, "Repairing the Breaches"; the second, "Including the Commandments"; the third, "The Secret of the Holy Language"; the fourth, "The Secret of the Letters of Creation"; the fifth, "The Threefold Speech"; the sixth, "The Unity of God"; the seventh, "The Transformation of the Letters"; the eighth, "The Secret of Pronouncing the Name"; the ninth, "The Secret of Binding and Unbinding"; and the tenth, "The Form of Prophecy." After mentioning them in general, we will return to explain them in detail, each part according to what it can bear of explanation, as far as our intellect can grasp, trusting in the higher power that inspires our understanding for this, even if we were not worthy of it.





Part 1

The first part consists of the letters Aleph, Bet, Gimmel, Dalet, and Hey, and its essence is associated with the name Avraham.
The first section, which is the matter of Aleph, includes the concept of the breach:
At the beginning of the stages that everyone seeking God's glory must go through is the avoidance of breaching a fence, lest a snake dwell there. This is a common occurrence where people, accustomed to making breaches to trap, as hinted by King Solomon in Ecclesiastes [10:8], 'He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.' Due to the fact that this connection includes various distinct aspects, which are very evident in our generation, we have initiated it with the matter of the breach of walls, in the ancient days when many wise men stumbled in this, as Daniel prophesied [12:10], 'Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white and be refined, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.' He gave a reason for this by saying, 'And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.' Thus, we began with the matter of breaching fences, as was the downfall of many in ancient times, as Daniel foretold [11:35], 'And some of the wise shall stumble, so that they may be refined, purified, and made white, until the time of the end, for it still awaits the appointed time.' He provided a rationale for this, saying, 'to refine and to cleanse them, but the wicked shall act wickedly. And none of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.' And he gave a reason for this as well, saying, 'None of the wicked shall understand, but those who are wise shall understand.' This will increase knowledge, as he said [Daniel 12:4], 'But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase.' Because breaches have increased, they have since prevented the priests from blessing using the explicit Name as prescribed. However, they agreed to bless the people with the Name in the Temple, as the Scripture instructs, and in the country with its various appellations [Sotah 38a].
And behold, the breaches in their understanding were the secrets of God. They were breaking the fence of the Torah and the commandments, losing faith when reaching the realization that true faith contradicted their false thoughts and evil imaginations. This is demonstrated when a person believes in one thing, and there is no balance in his hands to weigh and consider, namely, the faith he received in his childhood. For if he did not accept any faith, he would remain forever like an animal in human form. Nevertheless, after his intellect grows, and he investigates and examines his accepted belief, it becomes refined and well-grounded. On this, it is said [Proverbs 14:15], 'The naive believes everything, but the sensible man considers his steps.' If he consistently holds an accepted belief that is not understood according to his elevated, divine intellect, he will remain somewhat naive. Yet, as he becomes aware of some of the simplicity in his belief and gains understanding, he gradually ascends from one level to another. His intellect grows each day as he contemplates sophisticated matters that he has accepted. Subtle ideas draw him after tangible ones, and one should not suspect his disciples, followers, or teachers, as they did not reveal to him the secrets of faith in his childhood, for he was not fit for them. However, his intellectual weakness remained, and he continues to be somewhat naive. It is not fitting to blame his nurse who nursed him with her milk, for not feeding him other solid foods immediately, as it would have been much easier for her to sustain him externally than from what she was nursing him. But she intends to nurture him wisely, not to kill him with unsuitable nourishment, which is known to be poisonous for the weak. Just as bread, meat, and wine, though they sustain the strong, are lethal poison for the weak. This is evident, as these foods are poisonous for the weak who cannot endure them. Similarly, accepting sophisticated faith with the accepted, but not understood, faith, according to the level befitting his wise intellect, he still stands in his naivety. However, as he understands his accepted belief from his childhood, he becomes less naive and more discerning. 
Indeed, if a person reveals to you one secret, and you notice him being bewildered and astonished, thinking that the strength of his faith has departed from him, and he perceives you as foolish or a heretic, do not feed him the elixir of life, lest you kill him, and his soul is sought from your hands. Solomon already warned you about him, saying [Proverbs 23:9], 'Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.' Do not overstep the ancient boundary that the predecessors established. According to this matter, you should examine the capacity of everyone who accepts a sophisticated or accepted matter and understand him according to what he is. The first secret you reveal to him should be from the easy matters that are on your lips, not from what is in your heart. What is in your heart should not be revealed to the public; in your actions, give each person his due, and follow the ways of the blessed Lord, who provides bread for all flesh and satisfies the desire of every living thing, willingly, as He desires, according to what one recognizes in Him. Endeavor in this matter to give to each person according to his ways and the fruit of his deeds. If instructive words that breach the fence emerge from your mouth, run quickly and repair the breach with him until his intention reverts to what it was initially. Employ strategy until he does not sense or comprehend your intention in any way. In this manner, you will be called a repairer of breaches.
...Part 2, Topic 2, Sign 2, encompasses the essence of the benefit of intention:
Every action a person directs himself towards requires that it serves a small or great benefit. If one does not aim for this, his action will be without supervision. The concept of supervision indicates intention, will, and choice. One who acts without them is considered to act arbitrarily, even if he performs a necessary action dictated by nature that he has no intention for. It is possible that if he could do without it, he would be pleased, and he would never perform that action. For instance, if one has a weak stomach, it is known that bread, meat, and wine, despite being vital for the robust, are deadly poison for the weak. In this case, intention is required to direct him to consume what is beneficial, as nature does not compel him to eat harmful food. Even though nature accepts the beneficial food and acts upon it in the form of intention, even if it does not have intention and does not receive the harmful food in the same way, the harmful element affects him contrary to his action. The intention, impressed by nature, was to preserve the nature of the food according to its composition, to safeguard that food perpetually according to the balance of its nature. If someone's intention is half-hearted to create things for the sake of the beneficial and the essential loss due to existence, then it is fitting for someone whose entire benefit lies in it to direct his actions to benefit himself. If he does so, his action will be that of an intelligent being. The more complete human intellect is in a person directing himself towards benefit, the greater the benefit will be in its relevance. Certainly, it will be stronger and more complete if it shares some divine intellectual intention with his own intention. Then, the essence of the benefit will reach the essence of intention.
And it is well known to every intelligent person that the complete benefit attained when he is a guardian of the breach is the avoidance of all possible harm. If the breach was minor and many would be harmed by it, the essence of the benefit is further distant and more honorable. If the breach benefits both individuals and many, either physically or monetarily, then certainly if the breach benefits individuals and many in the salvation of souls, all the more so. Therefore, anyone who is a leader of the state or part of its leadership or many states, when he directs his actions to organize the people of his generation, establishes regulations, and enacts laws to define breaches in the generation, and elevates his secrets to higher levels until he reaches the benefit of financial gain for the people, and from there to the benefit of their well-being, tranquility, and health in their bodies, and from there to the benefit of their enjoying wisdom leading to the eternal life of the souls.
"So it is, the man in his actions has reached it, and all who listen to his words and follow him towards the ultimate goal of benefit. If the essence of all benefit is inherently good, necessarily, this last benefit is to attain what was the purpose of the creation of man in the lowly world. If so, the essence of this ultimate benefit, which is the attainment of the eternal afterlife, was the intention of all the initial and intermediate benefits, and if it is achieved, the supreme intention in them is fulfilled. If not, the intention is absent and becomes null. It is known that placing the ultimate benefit in the totality of existence, shared with the reality of man, is always aimed to actualize it. If it falls short or lacks from reality, that which does not reach it is the aforementioned man who loses out. It is possible that another person may reach it, thus preserving the species to ensure that this person attains and completes the deficiency of the other. If so, from the perspective of the one who directs, it has been clarified that the essence of the ultimate benefit exists for some individuals of the species."
Part 4, Subject 4, Symbol 5. Including the Reason for Essential Benefit:
There is no doubt that after the first intention, there was an aim towards the reality of benefit from what was done; the benefit is essential and obliged to be found. And if its existence satisfies only a small part of human aspects, it becomes more honored among the receiving people when it increases. Just as the existence of human individuals is necessary, and although it was possible that these beings, or others before their creation, could exist, after their creation, it will be said about them that they are obliged by the nature of their cause, and their existence is possible in their own essence. The primary cause of their existence, which aimed at their purpose and depicted the essence of their benefit according to their own being, stands possible at the beginning of their existence and becomes obligatory and necessary at the end due to their creator.
This all relates to the belief of the existence of every individual being purposefully designed by its creator, meaning that whoever intended to create, designed the necessity of its benefit, and obliged it to be present before, with, or after him, i.e., at the time of our separation from the lower world. Just as we see that he intended to create his needs and benefits in this world, this is according to the belief of those who see all this as part of nature. Their senses and intellect have compelled them to acknowledge that this arrangement seems like a purposeful design, even though there is no intention attributed to it in their view. And we do not need to challenge their thoughts because our intention is far from theirs. Indeed, if not for the recognition of the reality of benefit, nothing would exist, just as one would say about food being essential to the nature of all that is nourished, and if it did not have an essential benefit for its existence, it would not be found.
Indeed, the five senses, including the sensory faculties, are essential for one's benefit. Among them, some are indispensable, meaning that existence is impossible without them for even a moment, and some are beneficial but not indispensable. The indispensable ones are the two closest to one's life, which are sight and hearing, and the beneficial ones are the three that are more spiritual than the former. They are sight, hearing, and smell. If a person does not see, it is possible for them to live; similarly, if they do not hear or smell. This is because the breath in the nose is not smell; rather, the breath, upon which life depends, is not part of the senses. The sense of smell is about detecting good, bad, or neutral odors. Breathing, in itself, is not smell. However, if one does not taste, we could also say that they can live without taste, as food is not taste. But since we observe that someone who does not have the desire for the taste of food will not wake up the desire to eat, and they will not be able to pass food through their throat. If they force it, they will vomit because their stomach cannot tolerate it. This would be the cause of their death. Therefore, we know that taste is connected to food, just as food is essential for life, so is taste. It is also said about the sense of touch that if it is not known that one who does not feel their flesh and blood is dead, if they are alive, then surely the others, which are the dwelling place of life, are alive as well. Even though the flesh and blood are alive, certainly after their death, and if so, this is a necessity of the reality of benefit, which is necessarily present when the living being is alive. Similarly, in some things:


And understand from this that there is nothing in the entire existence without a purpose. How much more so can the Torah and the commandments be without purpose? After all, in the existence of fleas, lice, and their eggs, there is a purpose in their creation, even if they cause inconvenience to humans. Certainly, there must be a purpose in things that are the essence of the world. This applies, in other words, to the Torah and the commandments.



After completing the sections of the first part in their details, we will now inform in general why we mentioned them at the beginning of this composition, which almost any thoughtful person might think is irrelevant to the purpose of the composition. The truth of our intention in this is as follows: Know that the ultimate purpose of human existence is in this world so that the first Intelligent Being, who is the supreme Primary Intellect comprehending all intellectibles, can discern and comprehend Himself, which includes all essences beneath Him in His intellectual capacity. Anything added by any intellect, and for the intellect to comprehend itself, will be more honorable and excellent for Him and beloved and pleasant to Him than others below Him. It will be more similar to Him than others among those who attain in our time. Anything that does not bear the truth of its Existence will move away from him, and will increase its distance as his knowledge grows. It will add distance at the time of his intellectual growth unless he endeavors to add that to his understanding. This refers to the enlargement of his knowledge when he gets closer to the time of attainment. These are the days of old age and senility. If he becomes wise in his old age, without giving up the wisdom that is knowledge, as it is said (Job 12:12), "Wisdom is with aged men, and understanding in length of days," and he adds to cleave to the vanity of this world while he approaches parting from it naturally, then he will add some pressing concern every day. This person, if he ages and thinks that he has become wiser, is in fact an old fool.
And if he thinks to say, "Here I am, keeping what my Creator commanded me, observing some of His commandments," he needs to wake up from his slumber. If it is a deep sleep, a good nap, let his merits awaken him with a strong shake. Otherwise, he might abandon it to sleep the eternal sleep and not wake up. Warn him that after old age, there is no time for regrets, and he should make up for what he has missed and preserve his Creator's commandments. He might think that those missed opportunities have already passed due to nature, and he does not need to heed his Creator's warnings. Note that after those missed opportunities, the evil inclination becomes stronger, and it truly operates much during the time of choices and less during youth. There is no active role in old age, except perhaps in thought, not in action. The power to act weakens, and the reason for heat in nature is the boiling of the blood. An old person has very cold blood, and it is not a strong warm heat, as the dominant force is the black bile, whose nature is cold and dry. Dust seeks its share, which is most of the body composed of it. All the hard things in the body, such as bones, tendons, gallbladder, nails, hair, and similar things that do not feel during their lifetime are dead, even when the blood is boiling, let alone afterwards. For them, actions that involve movement are close to impossible, and therefore, the movements of the elderly weaken in old age. After all, what kind of transgressions can an old person do once he weakens?
And if you say, "I can sin with my mouth and in my heart," after transgressions are found in the three primary places, which are the heart, the mouth, and the action, you will understand my intention regarding this in the second part. However, the commandments he thinks to fulfill, it is known that all of them are derived after the specific commandment, which is the secret of the first utterance in the Ten Commandments. Also, all transgressions are derived after the second utterance. Our sages already said that anyone who confesses idolatry denies the entire Torah, and anyone who denies idolatry confesses the entire Torah. Now you can see that the entire Torah depends on the first two utterances. If a person does not recognize what is called idolatry in general and specifically, he will not know how to deny it in his heart. If he denies it with his mouth, this is not enough for completeness. Even if he is good and compassionate, he cannot achieve the essence of renouncing idolatry in the ultimate understanding. It is only through the acquisition of knowledge of the glorious and awesome name. Since this acquisition is only suitable for someone who is elderly in wisdom and in age, as he will attain the wisdom of the true nature of things in their entirety, he will also attain an understanding of idolatry, and the strength of the Lord. They agreed to hand it over to the deserving and to prevent it from someone who is not deserving. Since all opinions are not equal, they formulated conditions for the knowledge of the name so that one who already knows the name, having exempted himself from everything that previously happened necessarily for the knowledge of the name, while not having the ability to perform, will not think that he has fulfilled his obligation. But the right thing to do is to observe both protections because one fulfills the other, and the other fulfills the one, in the likeness of the body and the soul, both necessary for each other. In the image of the letter with the point, for existence for both simultaneously, even though the letter implies the body and the point implies the soul, as the point moves the letter and the letter moves, and knowledge moves both of them. It is similar to the wise leader guiding both the body and the soul together.
And when a person wishes to transmit one tradition in the knowledge of the Name, he must transmit it to the guardians, as if there were no written commandments anywhere. For all of them, the strong natural inclination dictates that they would renew them according to their own judgment. Because the boundary of the transgression is similar to the giving of the commandment, except that this is with human intellect, and that is with a partnership of divine intellect with human intellect. After this is done, certainly the complete transmitter will not break any boundary, but he will make every effort to enclose transgressions in the place of the breach according to the generation and the time.

Part 2

Part B, its letters are Vav, Zayin, Chet, and Tet. It consists of five sections, and its subject matter is five. The name is Sephardi.
Section 6, Sign 6: Matter A, Sign S, includes all the commandments....
Each and every commandment from the 613 commandments that Moses our teacher, may he rest in peace, commanded us according to the Lord, as it is said (Deuteronomy 33:4), "Moses commanded us the Torah, an inheritance for the congregation of Jacob," is connected to the secret of the Torah, which is in the numerical value of 611. And similarly, it is connected, as it is written (Deuteronomy 10:20), "You shall fear the Lord, your God," and also, "and you shall fear your God," which is the secret of the fear of heaven. And it is also written (Proverbs 1:7), "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." Now, you should know that there remain from the 613 commandments two commandments, and they are the two extremes. The first extreme is at the pinnacle of elevation that has no elevation beyond it, and it is the secret of knowing the Name. If you think to reach its ultimate, you will need to be a separate intellect. This is prevented from every material entity, but you need to know from it what is not fitting for you to be an intellect in it, from the aspect of being an image of God and having the likeness of God. Each and every commandment from the 613 commandments that Moses our teacher, may he rest in peace, commanded us according to the Lord, as it is said (Deuteronomy 33:4), "Moses commanded us the Torah, an inheritance for the congregation of Jacob," is connected to the secret of the Torah, which is in the numerical value of 611. And similarly, it is connected, as it is written (Deuteronomy 10:20), "You shall fear the Lord, your God," and also, "and you shall fear your God," which is the secret of the fear of heaven. And it is also written (Proverbs 1:7), "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction." Now, you should know that there remain from the 613 commandments two commandments, and they are the two extremes. The first extreme is at the pinnacle of elevation that has no elevation beyond it, and it is the secret of knowing the Name. If you think to reach its ultimate, you will need to be a separate intellect. This is prevented from every material entity, but you need to know from it what is not fitting for you to be an intellect in it, from the aspect of being an image of God and having the likeness of God.

After you sketch the two mentioned edges, representing the faith not attached to actions, draw the Torah as an intermediary between them. This is because Talmud Torah informs you about the path of proper actions you should follow and the improper actions you should distance yourself from. Since all the commandments are derived from faith, they correspond to the numerical value of the divine name. Their secret is in the verse (Exodus 3:15), "This is My name forever, and this is My remembrance from generation to generation." When you connect "This is My name," you will find that it sums to 72. When you connect "This is My remembrance," you will find that it sums to 49. Combine these two, and you get 121, which is the numerical value of the divine name. If you add another Yud (10) for "This is," you get 131. Combine this with the value of "Zachri" (My remembrance), and you get 156. Add "Vehaya" (And it shall be), and you will have 161. Connect "My name," and you get 155. Combine them all, and you'll get 777. Your mnemonic is "Moses, our Rabbi." Place Kaf (20) from "Rabbeinu" with the Shin (300) from "Moshe," and you will be left with Yud Hey (15). Add "Vayetze Lach" (And it shall go out for you), and you get 26, the numerical value of the divine name.
And behold, the numerical value of 155 is like the number of days of the sun, and 248 is like the number of human limbs. What corresponds to the organs is a hint from the Name to perform commandments with them, meaning to allude that no organ was created in you except to serve the Creator, not for anything else. Indeed, they correspond to the number of positive commandments. If you serve them for anything other than Him, you are serving other gods. Therefore, it is fitting to serve the Name, which is God Almighty, and which corresponds to other gods in all your organs through positive commandments. If you understand the Name, your service will be complete, as all your organs will move according to their functions after the intention of fulfilling that unique purpose in all your goals. Even in the moments of your carrying, moving, eating, and drinking, contemplate them, and time will not burden you with its vanities to distract you from continuing your actions, except in a situation or out of the necessity of human nature.
And concerning this, the negative commandments are like the number of the days of the sun, which is 365, to allude that you should not perform your actions according to the vanities of time. Since the sun is cut off continually, and the affairs of human beings roll from year to year, changing altogether, the limbs of a person are counted according to the solar years. This signifies a warning against engaging in fleeting pleasures that change from time to time. 
The illustration emphasizes the ever-changing nature of transient delights experienced by the limbs, akin to clouds in the sky or morning dew that passes in their appointed times. All these are vanity and passing futilities that do not leave any lasting impact on individual matters, neither in essence nor in circumstance, but are like a fleeting cloud or morning dew that vanishes quickly without any residue in the affairs of an individual.
And behold, all the commandments that we were commanded are intended as preparatory steps for attainment because without preparation, attainment is incomplete. Without complete attainment, perfect faith is lacking, and without perfect faith, sustainable service is absent. Without lasting service, there is no enduring recompense. If there is no limit to the recompense, the created being does not fulfill the true purpose of its existence. The analogy in this is like someone who did not go to the market, did not purchase food. If he bought it and did not bring it home to prepare it, he will not cook it. If he put it in a bowl after cooking it, if he has reached that point, he will not eat it. If he ate it, he will not live by it. And if he ate it and reached the ultimate goal of his intention, that he ate a reasonable amount of average quality and lived by it. Similarly, with the commandments, if one fulfills one of them and neglects another closely related to it by nature, he will find that he has lost the first. And if he fulfills the second, he must also fulfill the one close to it. This is hinted at in their saying, "One mitzvah brings another mitzvah," and likewise with transgressions, for one transgression leads to another. This is hinted at in their saying, "The reward of a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the reward of a transgression is a transgression." If one ascends from one mitzvah to another, whether from a minor to a major or from a major to a major, it is possible that the secret of the ultimate purpose will be fulfilled for him.
It is known that one whose intellect is complete will observe all the commandments with all his abilities. For if these commandments had not existed, he would have recreated and discovered them, especially given their complete existence. It is impossible to generate goodness beyond them eternally. Therefore, it is not appropriate to add to them or subtract from them. If you argue in your opinion that after a person reaches the highest level, which is the ultimate goal—knowledge of God—what use are the commandments? I show you that a person needs them throughout his life because they were not commanded to be observed for their own sake, but rather to withstand their power against the evil inclination and to strengthen the power of the good inclination. After these two inclinations do not separate from a person throughout his life, if he does not observe the commandments, the divine purpose may be reversed in him. Perhaps his nature will occasionally prevail over his intellect, causing him to lose everything he gained throughout his life. Additionally, you see from God's creation of the world, following the straightforward interpretation of the Torah in the six days of creation, that He did not abandon it without supervision after completing it. The Torah and the commandments are still observed, even though you reach one specific goal from them. You must always observe their details and entirety with complete supervision. I emphasize that if you do not continuously study, you will forget what you learned. Similarly, if you do not perform the commandments, the strength of your good inclination will continually weaken, and you will not perceive it. What else can I add to inform you about the general principle of the commandments? I know that if you are an intelligent person who understands the intention of God in all the commandments, then after that, the hint implied in this second section will be apparent to you. If not, everything I am saying to you regarding the observance of the commandments will be similar to one who plays music before deaf people.
After having informed you completely, I will conclude this matter for you based on what I know and have informed you in this book. It relates to the capability of an elderly person to sin with his mouth and heart, concerning speech and thought. After all, speech is the distinction by which a person differs from other living beings. Thought is also a characteristic of a person and is distinguished in its own right. One might think that sinning with speech and thought is greater than sinning through actions, and this is true to some extent:
Here, I inform you briefly: know that a person should be judged based on the matter in which he can fulfill the desire of his Creator more than when he fails to fulfill his own desire. It is more appropriate to judge him on the matter related to the desire of his Creator than to judge him on a matter distant from the desire of his Creator. The matter closely related to the desire of the Creator is more significant than the good deed itself. An illustration of this is that even though the speech and thought of the Creator were perfect in themselves, and His thoughts were complete within Him, until He expressed His speech and thought into action through His work, which He performed for the benefit of all living beings, His perfection was not known. Despite having no need for it, we observe that it was His desire, and through this, He made His wondrous deeds visible to all creatures. If it were not for His deeds, who would comprehend Him among those who comprehend? Although the deeds are also shared with those who comprehend, and those who comprehend are also created beings:
Here, we have conveyed that our understanding of Him is derived solely from observing His deeds, which bear witness to His greatness. Similarly, by way of analogy in the case of an elder, even though his strength may have weakened, he has already performed deeds. If they were good, they are already evident, and if they were bad, their negative effects are already noticeable. Furthermore, they continue to have an impact. If he utters something inappropriate, those who hear the bad deed will attribute it to him, calling him a wicked person. If he says something good, those who hear the just deed will consider him righteous. However, his thoughts only contain images, and if he sins through foolishness, he transgresses unintentionally. Yet, he is judged only for the deed. If he intends to commit a transgression, he is not held accountable for his thoughts until he actualizes them. In a positive sense, this is the opposite. Regarding this, our Sages hinted (Kiddushin 40a): God attaches good thoughts to action, and a bad thought is not linked to action until one performs the deed. This is a general principle of the attributes of mercy. Therefore, the considered and spoken goal is not established without action. Action is what actualizes the goal according to what is spoken and thought. To one with good intellect, I have already explained the secret of all the commandments, with a few exceptions based on the context.
Part 7, Topic 2, Section 80, encompasses the essence of the benefit of the commandments:
It is said that each commandment is connected to its counterpart, and the entire world is eternal. Each part is linked to another, and the whole is like one individual, similar to Abraham, who is set in unity. The human body also consists of two parts, where each limb is connected to another. The Torah verses testify that these are linked to those, forming a third connection. One who understands the secret of the essence of the benefit of each and every commandment also knows the secret of the connections mentioned, the essence of their benefit, and the interconnection between them. The benefit intended by a commandment may be found at the beginning, within, at the end, in all three, or in some part of it. Specifically concerning the commandment, each one stands on its own, and its benefit exists when it is actualized for itself initially. Perhaps later, it will bring additional benefits. After the commandments are interconnected, many benefits arise according to the intent of the blessed commandment, and the highest benefit in all its benefits is ultimately directed towards God. The wise one, Maimonides, hinted at this matter in the reality of the celestial spheres, as known from his esteemed work "Guide for the Perplexed," Part III. After the commandments are connected to each other, the essence of their benefit is clarified in general concerning the connection between them and the knowledge of God. Therefore, our sages warned (Pirkei Avot 2:1), "Be as scrupulous in observing a minor commandment as you are with a severe one, for you do not know the reward of each commandment.
Part 8, Topic 3, Section 200, encompasses the necessity of the actuality of the benefit of the commandment:
It is known that after the purpose of the commandments is to direct the mind of a person to the service of God and to reach His blessed attainment, if their actuality were not necessary according to the nature of humanity, God would not have advanced them for attainment. Since the purpose is the ultimate goal of the commandment, the necessity of the actuality of the benefit is more crucial than the actuality of the commandment itself. The benefit is divided into known parts, some of which are realized in this world and some in the world to come. Thus, it is clarified that there is an inseparable connection—meaning the inherent connection—between the actuality of the commandment and the inherent connection of the actuality of its benefit. This explanation does not require further elaboration.
Part 9, Topic 4, Section 4, which includes the rationale for the necessity of the commandment and its overall benefit:
It is explained that a person who comprehends his Creator and observes His commandments, fearing Him, is one for whom it is appropriate to say that the world was created for him from one perspective. And for one whom it is fitting to say that the world was created for his sake, it will soon be evident that there is a great reason, from his natural disposition, to present before him essential and beneficial commandments. If the commandments did not compel and direct a person, there is no living creature capable and knowledgeable enough to achieve salvation, which humans can. Therefore, it would not have been possible without commandments that complete the lacking and restrain the excessive until everything is arranged in perfect order. The one who adds will subtract until his situation changes, and the one who subtracts will add until his path merges. All this was a divine strategy until the natural principle emerged, encompassing the creation of man with proper Torah guidance. Each foolish person will resemble an intelligent one until the directed ones fulfill their purpose. After this is achieved, the rationale for each commandment and the overall benefit, as well as the reason for the necessity of their existence, are clarified, meaning the commandment and the benefit derived from it.
Part 10, Topic 5, Section 10, which includes the loss incurred due to the absence of the commandment:
After it has been established that the ultimate purpose of the benefit of the commandment is to bring its observer to the eternal life of the world to come, if so, the loss incurred due to its absence is proportional to the grandeur of its existence. Regarding this, the sages hinted when they said (Pirkei Avot 2:1), "Consider the loss caused by a mitzvah against its reward, and the reward of a transgression against its loss." Meaning, you should know that just as the benefit is great, so too is its loss. And how great is the loss of the commandment, as it is the cause for the loss of eternal life in the world to come, an irreversible loss that can never be found again, just as what is gained for it is retained forever. After we introduced the two mentioned chapters concerning the essential matter and how it is beneficial to our intentions, we will return to discuss further in the remaining eight sections, with the help of God.

Part 3

Part 3, Section 20, titled "The Second Part and its Topics," and the word "ben":
Part 20, Topic 1, Section 2, which includes the secrets of languages:
Every language found spreading among each nation requires understanding that its intention in existence, according to human nature, is not for its own sake. Instead, it is to transmit the concept considered in the soul of one person to the soul of another. The language, with its five oral organs, serves as a tool for the operation of that considered transmission. By "language," we mean the agreed-upon language of the nation. It is known and widely accepted by all that there are many languages, no less than seventy. The distinct nations with their unique laws are also no less than seventy. If there are more, it is not impossible, nor is it distant from reality. If that were the case, it would imply that there would be more languages, and then, according to the commonly accepted interpretation, considering the seventy nations as numerous, as the term "seven" or "seventy" in our language is often interpreted as meaning a majority, the difference from one nation to another necessitates a change in their laws, religions, some aspects of their culture, and their entire language, all of which are general aspects of their identity.

Part 4

The fourth part, whose letters' signs are מנסעפ, its divisions are five, and its matters are five, and its name is Shemuel:
Part "מ" signifies aspect "א," symbol "ש," encompassing the creation of man.
The Book of Formation [Chapter 3, Mishnah 4] testified that three things were created with twenty-two letters: the first is the world, the second is the year, and the third is the soul. The world comprises fire, water, and air, and they were created with אמ"ש. The seven planets were created with בג"ד כפר"ת, and the twelve constellations were created with הזחטילנסעק. This constitutes the general principle of mankind and its particulars generally. The year was created from the world and its elements, namely heat, cold, and moisture, which were also created from fire, water, and air, also with אמ"ש. The seven days of creation were created from the seven planets with בג"ד כפר"ת, as were the twelve months of the year with הזחטילנסעק. This constitutes the general principle of the year and its particulars generally. The soul was created from the world in its entirety and its parts, namely the head, the belly, and the limbs, which were created from fire, water, and air with אמ"ש as well. Likewise, there are seven gates [in the soul] corresponding to the seven planets with בג"ד כפר"ת, and there are twelve leaders [in the soul] corresponding to the twelve constellations with הזחטילנסעק as well. The world and all that was created are substantial, while the year and all its parts are accidental, and the soul and its parts are corporeal. Furthermore [Chapter 3, Mishnah 3], three things were also created from the elements known as fathers, roots, and foundations, namely heaven, earth, and air. All three are corporeal, but heaven is ethereal and pure, resembling fire; earth is dense, resembling water; and air is intermediate and shared, resembling air. Now, heaven is compared to a king on his throne, the cycle of the year to a king in his kingdom, and the heart in the soul to a king in war. The heaven is like an arrow, with its head in one constellation and its tail in the seventh. It shares in the portion of the steps, from ק"פ to ל"פ, the degrees in which the cycle is divided. Its head signifies merit, its tail signifies liability, and its heart decides between them. The cycle is like a circle with two extremities, and the middle one decides between them. The soul is an additional force upon the body's essence, propelling it and moving it incidentally. This force resides in the heart, forming its shape, hence called "heart." The soul is also called "blood," and the heart stands in relation to the blood. Blood was the first substance created in man, and hence, man with blood is related to others both in form and substance, like soil and likeness and silence. Each of these is distinguished for its own sake and also united with others for symbols.

Part 10


And you should know that one who knows a name needs to know the essential name, with which he was called on the day of his circumcision. Then he should connect it with the explicit name [of God], which is also [His] essential name. And there are parts to this and there are rules to it. There are some at the head [of the name], some in the middle and some at the end. At the head, like the matter of, "and Moshe called Hosheah the son of Nun, Yehoshua" (Numbers 12:16), such that he tied the Crown of [God's] name to his head. And in the middle, like the matter of Avram, such that God added a <i>hey</i>, which is the end of the Crown, to him. And the name was between the middle and the end; and with Avraham, the middle was close to the end. And in the end, Eliyah, which was completed to Eliyahu. And at its end, He tied the <i>vav</i> of His name to him. And so too, with many prophets. And in this fashion should one connect and change a name with [God's] name, to add content, to connect what is open and to open what is connected with the known names [of God]. This should be done in conjunction with the twelve constellations, with the seven stars and with the three foundational elements, until it is extended. And the one who connects and opens does so with the stringency of that which is tied (forbidden) and opened (permissible), and is clothed with a new form that has what is tied and the opened in it.






...The form of intellect is a form that is exceedingly subtle, refined, and innermost. Due to its immense brilliance and radiance, which illuminates the entire world, the beauty of its form is concealed, much like the beauty of the sun's light is hidden from the eyes of a bat or someone whose eyes are in pain. Although the light of the sun enables vision, the stronger the light becomes, the more one's eyes become dim due to their inherent weakness. The obstruction is not from the light itself but from the weak nature of the eyes. Similarly, the human soul, when it seeks to contemplate the source of its intellectual light, becomes weakened in its ability to grasp it. This is not because the source conceals its light but because the soul has a material aspect. If this is true for wisdom, it is even more so for other aspects. As the bat is to the sunlight, and the soul is to the light of intellect, so is every separate intellect when it contemplates the supreme intellect, which is the first cause of everything. This supreme intellect is the divine source of all, having brought everything into existence. Blessed and exalted is His name forever. Due to His supreme clarity and radiance, it is impossible to fully comprehend Him because His infinite beauty is beyond limits. Therefore, only He can know Himself, and anything that has no limit to our intellect does have a defined limit to Him, encompassing everything from all sides. Since everything that encompasses something else forms a shape around it, and He encompasses everything without being encompassed by anything (because He has no limit), He is called the form of every existent thing. Since everything is His creation and He is not created nor existent by anything else (being the sole cause of everything), He is necessarily existent by His essence. Everything else is necessarily existent by its cause and can potentially exist by its essence but necessarily ceases to exist if its cause ceases. Therefore, He is called the Creator, the Doer, or the Maker, and similar names indicating creation. When it is understood that everything is His creation, it is said that everything is like clay in the hands of the potter. This is the form called the form of intellect, which human intellect can conceptualize, along with other intelligible forms derived from Him, meaning His attributes, actions, and influences through known and established paths. Anyone who contemplates the Guide for the Perplexed will find their soul's confusion resolved, as it is the healer of troubled souls and the preserver of the healthy. It is said to be at the command of God through Moses, who is an expert healer providing free healing. Its interpretation is that Moses revealed the Torah of Moses by the command of God, which is the form of intellect.
